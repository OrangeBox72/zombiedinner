Look! You didn't want to hear this I know, but you are a ZOMBIE!
And I know that you really don't want to hear that you love to eat BRAINS!
Did I mention that there are 'others' who just want to deprive you of
your natural ambitions? FYI - They will shoot you with their 'Big Bang' sticks!

Well, good luck. 


_Zombie Dinner_ takes simple input.
After each roll.. you will need to type a 'y' to continue to roll,
or any other key to quit the round.
Game scoring is done the 'good ol fashion way' w/pen and paper.
  (pencils are accepted as well, but we all know the ol' wives tale
   about pencils and zombies.. heh heh heh.)
  (oh, you don't know the ol' wives tale about pencils and zombies?
   well actually, neither do I.. but I interpreted via a TikTok video
   that it has something to do with pencils causing irritations in 
   zombie nasal cavities.  Don't believe me.. just Zoogle it.)

Plenty of stats are given to help your average zombie make intelligent decisions.
NOTE: Programming zombies to have intelligence was a monumental undertaking.  (your welcome / or not).

WARNING: Do not use _Zombie Dinner_ in the event of a real zombie apocalypse!
