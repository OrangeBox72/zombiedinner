The only input that one can give when playing _Zombie Dice_, is deciding
when to stop rolling.  Since the standard computer has no AI, this
game plays through one round of Zombiedice stopping only when either
* 3 shotguns are rolled
* a score of 7 or more is accrued


**Requirements**
In order to compile, you will need to ensure that you have installed
*github.com/fatih/color* - for ANSI color needs.
Please read the *INSTALL.MD* file for info on how to get started with GO.
